\section{Objectives}
Below is the requirements document for picocopter, a very tiny quadcopter.

\section{Overview}

\subsection{Objectives}
\textit{Why are we doing this project? What is the purpose? }\\ \\
The purpose of this project is to design an embedded system from the ground up. This will give students experience on every part of the design cycle. It also gives students an opportunity to design and print their own PCB, and design their own software system. Our specific project is planned to be a self hovering/stablizing quadcopter.

\subsection{Roles and Responsibilities}
\textit{Who will do what? Who are the clients?}\\ \\
The engineers are Reece Stevens and Alex Gerome, and the TA is the client. The group has modified the provided requirements document to clarify exactly what we plan to build. Our current plans are to work on each part of the lab in tandem.

\subsection{Interactions with Existing Systems}
\textit{How will it fit in?}\\ \\
The system will use the TM4C123 chip, and a specially printed PCB to handle our needs.


\section{Function Description}

\subsection{Functionality}
\textit{What will the system do precisely?}\\ \\
The system will be a quadcopter. It will be designed to hover and stablize itself in a 3D space. Once turned on, it will levitate to a certain height, and then maintain that position until turned off.

\subsection{Performance}
\textit{Define the measures and describe how they will be determined.}\\ \\
All software must be clear and concise. The PCB and hardware must also be laid out in a manner that makes sense, and minimizes PCB area; this is to reduce the footprint of the system. The system's success will be measured by the stability of the system while hovering, and it's ability to regain stability when disrupted.


\subsection{Usability}
\textit{Describe the interfaces. Be quantitative if possible.}\\ \\
There will be an on/off switch for the system. Once activated, the system will turn off, and the accelerometer will send data to the TM4C chip. The accelerometer will be used to stablize the quadcopter.

\subsection{Safety}
\textit{Explain any safety requirements and how they will be measured.}\\ \\
Since we are dealing with a flying object, the system will not be run in close quarters, and necessary precaution will be taken when people are nearby.

\section{Deliverables}

\subsection{Reports}
\textit{How will the system be described?}\\ \\
Lab reports for labs 7 and 11 will be written, and necessary source files will be submitted.

\subsection{Outcomes}
\textit{What are the deliverables? How do we know when it is done?}\\ \\
There are three deliverables: preparation, demonstration, and report. The following will be included with Lab 7:
\begin{enumerate}[A)]
\item Objectives: 1-page requirements document
\item Hardware Design: Regular circuit diagram (SCH file), PCB layout and three printouts (top, bottom and combined) 
\item Software Design: Include the requirements document (Preparation a)
\item Measurement Data: Give the estimated current (Procedure d), Give the estimated cost (Procedure e)
\item Analysis and Discussion: (none)\\
\end{enumerate}

And the following are the contents of the lab 11 report:
\begin{enumerate}[A)]
\item Objectives: 2-page requirements document
\item Hardware Design: Detailed circuit diagram of the system (from Lab 7)
\item Software Design: (no software printout in the report) Briefly explain how your software works (1/2 page maximum)
\item Measurement Data: Include data as appropriate for your system. Explain how the data was collected.
\item Analysis and Discussion: (none). The YouTube video is required
\end{enumerate}

\section{Software Design}

The software for picocopter is comprised of an accelerometer module, four motor
PWM modules, and P (no ID) controller. At a high level, it is a feedback loop
system with the input being motor speeds and feedback information being the
accelerometer data. The goal of picocopter to stay afloat means minimizing
deviations from 0 on all axes of the accelerometer.

The accelerometer used is an ST LIS2HH12TR, a MEMS 3-axis accelerometer. The
low-level registers and basic communication protocols are implemented in
\texttt{accelerometer.c}. Data collection is triggered by a \texttt{DATA\_READY}
pin on the accelerometer; each read stores the data in an unsafe struct. When
reading the data, the main loop will disable the edge triggered interrupt and
move the contents of this unsafe struct to a safe global, then re-enable
the data ready interrupt. This way, the main function receives only the most
up-to-date information from the accelerometer; older samples that are no longer
relevant are dropped.

For each of the four motors, a PWM channel is enabled. Each motor is
addressable by its \texttt{motor\_t} identifier, so that the main loop can
independently set the duty cycle for each motor using the \texttt{set\_motor}
function.

Finally, the accelerometer information is used to calculate the new motor
speeds in the main loop via the P controller. The output of the accelerometer
is mapped to the range of the duty cycle settings for each motor, and this
value is used to update the motor speeds (see
\texttt{main.c:p\_controller\_update} for more implementation details).
